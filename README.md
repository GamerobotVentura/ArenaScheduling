# INSTRUCTIONS 

**PLEASE NOTE:** This method requires Autohotkey, which is **not available on macOS** and is only available to Windows nerds.
## Installing AutoHotkey


**What is AutoHotkey?**

AutoHotkey is a free and open source software that lets you execute a task when a key combination is pressed, hence the name AutoHotkey. 

**Installing AutoHotkey**

1. Visit the AutoHotkey download page: [AutoHotkey Download](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Click the **Download** button.
3. Select the most recent version. I am using v2.0.
4. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. You can usually accept the default settings and click **Install**.

## Creating the Script

1. Right-click anywhere on your desktop background and select **New > AutoHotkey Script** to create an empty .ahk script. Name this whatever thy heart desires. 
2. The new script file will appear on your desktop, for example "New Script.ahk" 
3. **Right-click** the new script file and select **Edit in Notepad** to open the script in Notepad to use as a text editor.
4. Copy the contents of the above [TemplateScript.ahk](https://github.com/GamerobotVentura/ArenaScheduling/blob/main/TemplateScript.ahk) and paste it into your new script.
5. Change all the placeholder texts such as "teacher1" to the last name of your teacher in that desired period. 
6. **Save** your changes (**File > Save**)

## Running the Script

1. Once you've saved your changes, **Double-click** the AutoHotkey script file on your desktop to run it. 
2. The script will now run in the background. **If you make any additional changes to your script, you will need to save and run the script again**.
3. To use, go to the Arena Scheduling tab in Skyward. Select the textbox where you search for your teacher's last name and then press ctrl + [period] to immediately filter for the period you want. For example, ctrl + 1 for your period 1 class and ctrl + 5 for your period 5 class. **Always remember to click the textbox again before pressing another hotkey shortcut. Practice searching for your teachers with this method so you don't mess up during the real thing and slow yourself down.** 

**Additional Notes**

* You can edit the script file to customize its behavior (refer to the AutoHotkey documentation for details). (I do not recommend this)
* To stop the script, right-click on the script icon in the system tray (usually near the clock, may be hidden in an arrow popup icon) and select **Exit**.
