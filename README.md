## Installing AutoHotkey

**What is AutoHotkey?**

AutoHotkey is a free and open source software that lets you execute a task when a key combination is pressed, hence the name AutoHotkey. **Please Note: ** Autohotkey is not available on macOS and is only available to Windows nerds.

**Installing AutoHotkey**

1. Visit the AutoHotkey download page: [AutoHotkey Download](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Click the **Download** button.
3. Select the most recent version. I am using v2.0 and that will probably be the most recent version for you too because I'm guessing this doesn't get a lot of updates.
4. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. You can usually accept the default settings and click **Install**.

## Creating the Script

1. Right-click anywhere on your desktop background and select **New > AutoHotkey Script** to create an empty .ahk script. Name this whatever thy heart desires. 
2. The new script file will appear on your desktop, for example "New Script.ahk" 
4. **Right-click** the new script file and select **Edit in Notepad** to open the script in Notepad to use as a text editor. 

## Using the Script

The provided script is already written in this repository. Here's how to use it:

1. Copy the entire content of the script file (**File > Select All** then **Edit > Copy**).
2. Go back to your AutoHotkey script file (**New Script.ahk**).
3. Paste the copied content into the script file (**Edit > Paste**).
4. **Save** the script file (**File > Save**).

**Running the Script**

1. **Double-click** the AutoHotkey script file (**New Script.ahk**). 
2. The script will now run in the background.

**Additional Notes**

* You can edit the script file to customize its behavior (refer to the AutoHotkey documentation for details).
* To stop the script, right-click on the script icon in the system tray (usually near the clock) and select **Exit**.
